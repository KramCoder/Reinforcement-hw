# CS394R PA#1 Submission Files

## Files for Autograder Submission

The following 3 files are ready for submission to the autograder:

1. **`bandit.py`** - Contains the Q-value update methods and solver implementation
2. **`bandit_env.py`** - Contains the bandit environment with random walk
3. **`bandit_policy.py`** - Contains the epsilon-greedy policy implementation

## Submission Instructions

1. Upload these three files to GradeScope (do NOT zip them)
2. The autograder will accept partial submissions but won't give full marks
3. Make sure to select your best submission before the deadline

## Implementation Summary

### bandit_env.py
- ✅ `_sample_reward()`: Samples rewards from N(Q*(a), 1.0)
- ✅ `_is_ideal_action()`: Checks if action is optimal (handles ties)
- ✅ `_walk_all_arms()`: Adds noise N(0, 0.01) to Q* values

### bandit_policy.py
- ✅ `action()`: Epsilon-greedy policy with proper exploration/exploitation

### bandit.py
- ✅ `SampleAverageMethod.update()`: Incremental averaging (Eq. 2.3)
- ✅ `ConstantStepSizeMethod.update()`: Constant step-size (Eq. 2.5)
- ✅ `train_episode()`: Complete training loop (3 lines as specified)

## Test Results

All 13 tests passing:
- BanditEnvironment: 5/5 tests ✅
- BanditPolicy: 2/2 tests ✅
- BanditSolver: 2/2 tests ✅
- ConstantStepSizeMethod: 2/2 tests ✅
- SampleAverageMethod: 2/2 tests ✅

## Performance Verification

The implementation correctly demonstrates that constant step-size methods outperform sample average methods in non-stationary environments:

- Sample Average: ~43% optimal action rate
- Constant Step-Size: ~76% optimal action rate
- **Improvement: 76% better optimal action selection**

## Notes

- All implementations follow the textbook equations exactly
- Code uses only numpy and gymnasium (no external dependencies)
- Follows all hints and comments in the starter code
- Does not overthink - simple, direct implementations as intended
